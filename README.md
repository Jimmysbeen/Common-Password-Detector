# Common Password Dectetor
Hello this is a project that I've worked on because I'm board! Anyway the purpose is to detect the security of an inputted password
checking for common patterns and common passwords.
## Warning
This is just a passion project and I would highly reccomend using an actual Common Password Detector in an real environment, or use another project ontop of this.
# Requirements

# Quick Start
`1:` **Install the package:**
`[Insert Here]`
`2.` **Import the library into your script:**
```
import commonpasswords
```
`3.` **Use the Detect function:**
```
import commonpasswords
commonpasswords.detect("[password]", True/False)
```
# Detect Function
The function "dectect" detects if the inputted password is common or unsecure
```commonpasswords.detect([The password your trying to detect], [True/False Returns the reasons that is reduced points])```
