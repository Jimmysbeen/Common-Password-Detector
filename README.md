# Common Password Dectetor
Hello this is a project that I've worked on because I'm board! Anyway the purpose is to detect the security of an inputted password
checking for common patterns and common passwords.
## Warning
This is just a passion project and I would highly reccomend using an actual Common Password Detector in an real environment, or use another project ontop of this.
